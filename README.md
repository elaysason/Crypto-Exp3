## General
The goal is to use exp3 and variations of it in order to select the the coins will gain to most rewards and the least regret over a cretian timeframe.Based on [Bandit Algorithms](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf) chapter iii Exp3 algorithm and the expansions are based on [Evaluation and Analysis of the Performance of the EXP3 Algorithm in Stochastic Environments](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v24/seldin12a/seldin12a.pdf)

### Background
Exp3 is a simple algorithm used for adversarial bandits.Adversarial bandits stands for a "game" which the player have to choose one action which its reward is sampled from a certian distirbution. Our particular implention is in the context of cryptocurrencies historical prices. The goal is to choose to most lucrative coin over time.

## Program Structure
The first part is specific functions for the dataset. The second part is the implementaions of the algorithms:
* Basis - The implementaion with constant learning rate
* Expansion 1 - Implementaion with decarsing learning rate
* Expansion 2 - Uses some confidence parameter Î´ to create a lower bound on the regret in each round and deletes every action that its regret may be higher than the created lower bound

## Installation
I will use google as an example, but similar process can be performed on other notebook editors
1. Open google Colab
2. Clone the project by:
	```
	!git clone https://github.com/elaysason/ANALYSIS-SP500.git
	```

3. Now the folder is in your files on colab. Simpily download the notebook as showed
